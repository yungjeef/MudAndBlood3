# Mud and Blood 3

Mud and Blood 3 is a game currently in development. The game is intended to be a sequel to the popular WW2 strategy survival game Mud and Blood 2.

This game will take place in the modern era. The player will face endless waves of enemies. They can earn points by surviving each wave and completing certain objectives in the game. These points can in turn be used to deploy units, provide support or upgrade units.

I intend to improve upon the original Mud and Blood games by having better animations, in particular by taking advantage of the Unity Particle System and having colliders to ensure no overlap in units.
